Welcome to the official GitHub account for **The Bennet Diaries Project**.

This account serves as the central hub for the digital preservation and public dissemination of the journals and correspondence of Bradbury Bennet, Esq. (1797‚Äì1881). Our work is managed by a small team based at the University of Bristol, led by Dr. Evelyn Reed.

Our primary goal is to ensure the long-term preservation of these materials and to provide a stable, accessible platform for researchers and enthusiasts alike.
